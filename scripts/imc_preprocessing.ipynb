    "This concludes the conversion of the IMC rawdata into usable TIFFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipelines can be found in the `cp3_pipeline` folder in this repository. They were tested in `cellprofiler 3.1.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A) Cellprofiler: 1_prepare_ilastik\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we prepare the data for Ilastik pixel classification, by first removing strong outlier pixels, then scaling the images 2x and then taking random 500x500 crops to do the train the pixel classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parts of this module need to be adapted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) File list: choose all files in the `tiff` subfolder\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Default Output Folder: Choose the `ilastik` subfolder\n",
    "\n",
    "No further parts need to be adapted.\n",
    "In our 16 core computer this step takes ca 5 min for the example dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B) Ilatik: Train a pixel classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses the random crops generated in the last step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Make a new `pixel classification project`. Save the project file in the `ilastik` subfolder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Add the `.h5` random crops: Raw data -> Add Seperate Images -> Select all `.h5` images in the `ilastik` subfolder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Proceed to `Feature Selection`\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Select suitable features (or just everythin > 1 pixels)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Proceed to the classification:\n",
    "    - Add 3 labels:\n",
    "        - 1: Nuclei\n",
    "        - 2: Cytoplasma/membrane\n",
    "        - 3: Background\n",
    "        - -> For large datasets adding the labels can take a while\n",
    "    - Start labeling: \n",
    "        - The box next to `Input Data` can change the channels. What each channel corresponds to can be seen when looking in any of the `..._ilastik.csv` files in the `tiff` folder. The 0 channel correspond to the sum of all channels, very usefull to label the background.\n",
    "        - Use window leveling change the contrast. Right click on the `Input Data` -> `Adjust Thresholds` is also very usefull\n",
    "        - Label opiniated: If you see in the nucleus channel that two nuclei are stuck together but have a faint dip in intensity in between, label this as 2: Cytoplasma. Encyrcle nuclei with Cytoplasma\n",
    "        - Diseable `Live Update` for performance\n",
    "        - Frequently check the `Uncertainties`: This indicates which pixels the classifier profits most if they are labeled. A well trained classifier has low uncertainty within class regions (e.g. Nuclei) and high uncertainty at class borders (e.g. between nuclei and cytoplasma).\n",
    "        \n",
    "6) If you think the classifier is well trained, export the probabilities:\n",
    "        - Export Settings -> Source: Probabilities -> Choose Export Image Settings:\n",
    "            - Convert to datatype: Unsigned Integer 16 bit\n",
    "            - Renormalize: check\n",
    "            - Format: Tiff\n",
    "            - File: leave default\n",
    "        - Export all: This generates `_Probabilities.tiff` in the `ilastik` folder. They can be checked using any image viewer\n",
    "            - To generate uncertainty maps (good to identify regions that need training),\n",
    "            run the `Convert probabilities to uncertainties` section `#For training` below. This will put uncertainties in the uncertainty folder.\n",
    "            -> Well trained classifiers have low uncertainty (transparent) everywhere but at class borders which should be white.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        - Optional: Train again regions with high uncertainty, then proceed.\n",
    "        \n",
    "7) If you think that you are finished with classification, you need to apply the classifier to your whole dataset usingBatch processing:\n",
    "        - Make sure the Export Settings are still the same as in the step 6), then go to the 'Batch Processing' step in ilastik.\n",
    "        - Select raw data files -> select all `_s2.h5` files in the `tiff` folder. (sort by filetype, select all `H5` files).\n",
    "        => This step takes a while and is computationally intensive!\n",
    "        => Ca 15 min on 10 cores on the example data\n",
    "            \n",
    "        - Optional: use the below probability to uncertainty `#For the data` to convert all proabilities to uncertainties, check if there are any regions of high uncertainty and optionally crop the corresponding image part in imagej and add it to the training data.\n",
    "        - Note: store the `ilastik` folder with all the random crops and the trained classifier for reproducibility reasons.\n",
    "        \n",
    "### C) Cellprofiler: 2_segment_ilastik\n",
    "\n",
    "This step will segment the probabilities into masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to adapt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) File list: choose again all files from the `tiffs` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "2) It is important to check the `IdentifyPrimaryObjects` step, if the segmentation settings are suitable!\n",
    "    This might vary strongly between cell/tissue/training and needs attention! Use the test mode and try various settings.\n",
    "    Also note the `smooth` step immediately before: This can be also removed, I just happen get good results with this additional step.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Also the `MeasureObjectSizeShape` combined with `FilterObjects` is just some personal preference of mine, feel free to change\n",
    "\n",
    "4) `IdentifySecondaryObjects`: Here th mask is expanded to the full cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) `Rescale objects`: note that our segmentation was done on 2x upscaled images, this scales the masks down again. Note that potentially also the nuclei mask could be scaled down and further exported and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) The `Default Output Path` does not need to be adapted for this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note1: Seperating mask generation from mask measurement adds modularity and is thus highly recommended, as generating masks is one of the most resource intensive steps.\n",

    "8) `CorrectSpilloverMeasurement`: Here the intensity measurement can be spillover corrected. Note that this makes only sense for linear combinations of intensity measurements such as `MeanIntensity` or `TotalIntensity`. For these it is more accurate to do this after measurement than doing it on the pixel level beforehand. Note that for things with non linear transformations as `MedianIntensity`, this will not result in valid results and these measurements should be done on beforehand corrected images from `CorrectSpilloverApply`."
